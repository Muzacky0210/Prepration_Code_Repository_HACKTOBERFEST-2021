4. Clone the project by running `git clone https://github.com/<your-username-here>/Prepration_Code_Repository.git` in your terminal, replacing `<your-username-here>` with your account name.
5. Run `cd Prepration_Code_Repository` to get into the root directory.
6. Run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ashuprince121/Prepration_Code_Repository.git`.  This is so that you can refer to the original project as the `upstream` version.
7. You cant check your remotes using the command `git remote -v`. Initially you should see this:
```
origin	https://github.com/<your-username-here>/Prepration_Code_Repository.git (fetch)
